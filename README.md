I plan to build a platform that aggregates video tutorials. This side will
be like a Wikipedia for education. It will contain the most comprehesive list
of topics for each course and multiple videos taught by different teacher 
attacehed to each topic.This way the users can decide which teachers video they want to watch. The videowill be ranked by popularity.

All videos will be tags with multiple key words which will make it easeir to 
to be found if the topic has different names. For example the course "Fundametals of cumputer systems" is names EEE in Columbia George community college. 

The site will allow people to add videos and create topic just as Wikipedia allows users to all new content. 

*Note  - I have tried to multiple resourses but Ruby 2.1 does not work on my computer. So I decided to go ahead and submit this with Ruby 2.0.
